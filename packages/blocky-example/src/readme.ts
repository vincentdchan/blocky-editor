<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why does it use Preact instead of React?</h3>
<p>
Because it's small. React(used with ReactDOM) costs nearly 47kb after minified
and gzipped. And Preact costs 4kb.
I want the size of the editor to be as small as possible.
</p>
<p>
And Preact is closer to the DOM.
React has an abstract layer for event handling, which is complicated and useless for the editor.
</p>
<p>
Actually, you can wrap the editor in React/Vue/Angular.
It's easy to do that.
I don't have time to do that, and <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> is good enough for me.
