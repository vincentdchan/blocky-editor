# FAQ

## Is the Blocky editor based on other editors?

No, the Blocky editor is written from scratch using the native DOM API.

## Can I use the Blocky editor with Vue/Angular?

In theory, yes. The Blocky editor provides a full VanillaJS API, and you can add your bindings to your favorite frameworks. However, official support for Vue and Angular is not currently in the plans.
